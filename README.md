Repository for Project 1 
For our project we will analyze CTA ridership for the city of Chicago

Possible questions:
Does CTA ridership fluxuate based on time of the year?
Does CTA ridership fluxuate based on the weather or temperature?
Has Uber/Lyft and/or Divvy had an impact on CTA ridership?
Is this impact seen more in the L or on the bus?
What days of the week have the highest ridership? What about time of the day?
What stations or stops have the highest riderhip? Does that fluxuate on time of year? Or around major events?


Possible Data sources
data.gov chicago data on CTA (CTA volumes, divvy trips)
city of chicago or CTA api?
Uber/Lyft API
openweathermap API
